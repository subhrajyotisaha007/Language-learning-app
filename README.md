# Language-learning-app
This is language learning app with a flash card I decided to learn french so I added French. It will show one word and after some time it will show you the meaning also of it in English there two button one is for 'Known word' and another is for 'Unknown word', If I know the word and we click on it the word will not come again as I already know it. I used a csv file to save it. If I don't know it and click on 'Unknown' button then It will not save into the new file as it can come again to memorize.
I use first 100 words as per frequency .
